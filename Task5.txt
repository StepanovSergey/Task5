Realize this task using existent products XML. Create servlet that will respond on 
each request by content generated with the help of XSLT transformation. First page 
is the list of Categories with quantity of products inside all subcategories 
( CATEGORY_NAME (quantity of products)). Name of category is a link that will lead 
to the list of subcategories ( SUBCATEGORY_NAME (quantity of products inside)). 
Then subcategory link will get to the list of products with their information. This 
page contains ADD button to add new product on the next page and after SAVE button 
has been pressed you make again XSLT transformation to get XML with new product, 
save it and generate in the response list of products.
During addition of product(XSLT transformation) call the JAVA code using xalan 
extension to validate fields. Do not forget to put BACK/CANCEL button for returning 
on the previous page.
